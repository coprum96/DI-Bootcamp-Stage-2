# My Bootcamp Experience
I recently completed a bootcamp where I learned several new technologies and tools for web development. Some of the key skills that I acquired include:

JavaScript: a versatile programming language used for both front-end and back-end development.
TypeScript: a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and other features to improve code maintainability and scalability.
HTML5 and CSS3: the core building blocks of the web, used for creating the structure and style of web pages.
Bootstrap: a popular front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first web applications.
Canvas: a powerful HTML5 element used for creating dynamic, interactive graphics and animations.
jQuery: a lightweight JavaScript library used for simplifying common tasks in web development.
React and Redux: a popular front-end library and state management tool, respectively, for building complex, scalable web applications.
PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL: powerful relational database systems used for storing and managing data in web applications.
MongoDB: a popular NoSQL database system used for storing and managing unstructured data.
Node.js: a server-side JavaScript runtime environment used for building scalable, high-performance web applications.
Git and GitHub: industry-standard tools for version control and collaboration in software development.
REST API design: a set of principles and guidelines for designing scalable and maintainable web APIs.
Agile: a project management methodology used for iterative and incremental development.
Web App Architecture (MVC): a common architectural pattern used for building scalable, modular web applications.

Overall, I feel well-equipped to take on complex web development projects and I look forward to putting my skills to use in the real world.
