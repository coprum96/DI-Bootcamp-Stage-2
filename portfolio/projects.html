            <p class="journalist">Journalist: Hi there, it's great to meet you! Can you tell me a bit more about your background and what led you to become a Full-Stack Developer?</p>
            <p class="Stanislav">Me: Of course! My background is actually quite diverse. I have a degree in finance and insurance, but I also have a strong interest in psychology. After working in the finance industry for a few years, I started to notice the impact that technology was having on the industry, particularly in terms of customer experience.</p>
            <p class="journalist">Journalist: That's really interesting! Can you tell me more about your expertise in modern financial technologies and consumer behavior research?</p>
            <p class="Stanislav">Me: Absolutely. My experience in finance and insurance gave me a solid foundation in traditional financial technologies, but I have also kept up-to-date with modern FinTech developments. I have a strong interest in consumer behavior and how people make decisions, and I believe that technology can be used to create better, more personalized experiences for customers.</p>
            <p class="journalist">Journalist: That sounds great. How do you bring your commitment to excellence and passion for Triathlon into your work as a Full-Stack Developer?</p>
            <p class="Stanislav">Me:  Well, my commitment to excellence is reflected in everything I do. I believe that every project, no matter how big or small, deserves my full attention and effort. As for my passion for Triathlon, it has taught me a lot about discipline and perseverance, which are traits that are useful in any field. I apply these same principles to my work as a Full-Stack Developer, and I believe that they have helped me to achieve success in my career.</p>
